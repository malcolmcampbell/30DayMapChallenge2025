# 30DayMapChallenge2025

30DayMapChallenge for November 2025

A daily (or almost everyday, depending on the challenge!) mapping/cartography/data visualisation challenge aimed at the spatial community.

The idea is to create (and publish) maps based on different themes on each day of the month using the hashtag #30DayMapChallenge, You can prepare the maps beforehand, but the main idea is to publish maps from specific topics on specific days listed below. Just include a picture of the map when you post to Twitter with the hashtag. You don't have to sign up anywhere to participate. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies or the data you use in your maps. Doing less than 30 is also fine (doing all 30 is really rather hard!). See the Code of Conduct at the bottom of the page on github.

Again, trying to keep the repository of files, code and data to help teach (potential future) scholars and students about spatial in R Studio {sf, ggplot2, tmap, mapgl ...etc}

See the RCode folder for each R script file, the data file for data you may need and the Maps folder for images.

Happy mapping

Prof C. (Malcolm)
